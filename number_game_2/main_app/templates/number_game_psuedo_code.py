# # # NUMBER GAME PSUEDO CODE
# # first step is to create the random NUMBER
# #     already added import random
#         to do this we are gonna use a session key and store it in context, i.e.
#         if number != in request session, create session,
#         ensure the numbner is being pulled from the random.
# # get number in the system
# # make sure it's hidden
